## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Semantic HTML5 markup

I challenged myself to use semantic HTML5 as opposed to putting everything in divs.
So I learnt about the `<main>` and `<section>` tags. To better understand semantic HTML5, I visited examples of landing pages.

I also learnt about the "hero" section of the page, which is typically a prominent image, slider or text element.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Tutorial from Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me better understand CSS Grid. I will continue to apply the concepts taught in this tutorial.
